The principle behind the IDAC is to have a single PMOS transistor, 
a DAC to control the gate voltage of the PMOS.

The PMOS gate is pre-charged to approximately 5 uA.

A SAR algorithm is run on the DAC to modify the PMOS gate voltage.

The IDAC must be powered down, and powered up once in a while.
